### Who I am ‚ùì

As a student of the Master of Computer Science of the Gustave Eiffel University, I was given the opportunity to work on different projects that allowed me to put into practice several notions such as graph algorithms, tree algorithms, optimization, different programming paradigms (object-oriented, functional, declarative, web...).

I was able to discover throughout my training several languages such as Java (Version 19), C++, Python, C, Caml, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL and frameworks like Angular and React.
